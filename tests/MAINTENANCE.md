# Test Suite Maintenance Guide

The test suite is intentionally pragmatic. Its job is to be a **safety net, not a straitjacket**:
catch crashes, broken invariants, and pipeline regressions without freezing internal implementation details.

## File Layout

| File                       | Purpose                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conftest.py`              | Shared fixtures (price series, DataFrames, articles, signal dicts, mocks) |
| `test_core.py`             | Core sanity/invariant tests for pure functions                            |
| `test_pipeline.py`         | Smoke tests for end-to-end orchestration                                  |
| `test_logic_coverage.py`   | Additional edge coverage for scoring, sentiment, dedup, contradictions    |
| `test_storage_and_scan.py` | Storage retention/cleanup, round-trip, dry-run scan, synthetic backtest   |
| `test_optimisation.py`     | Optimisation-related tests                                                |
| `test_web_surface.py`      | Web demo surface tests                                                    |

The suite is no longer fixed to a tiny count. Add tests when they improve confidence on important logic.

## What each test file covers

### `test_core.py` and `test_logic_coverage.py`
Pure logic tests. These should verify either:
- The function runs without crashing, or
- A hard invariant/range, or
- A stable business rule (for example clamping, dedup threshold behavior, or contradiction detection).

Prefer robust assertions over fragile full-structure snapshots.

### `test_pipeline.py` and `test_storage_and_scan.py`
Integration/smoke coverage for:
- `analyse_asset()` and `run_full_scan()` with network mocked,
- `run_scan(dry_run=True)` execution,
- storage read/write/retention behaviors,
- synthetic backtest evaluation.

These tests should avoid enforcing unstable presentation details, but they should assert
meaningful pipeline outcomes (no crash, sane outputs, expected side effects).

---

## Import paths

Canonical imports use the `pulseengine.*` package. The existing test files import from the backward-compat shims intentionally — this verifies the shims themselves remain functional. New tests should prefer canonical paths.

| Import style                             | Module resolved                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `from pulseengine.core.app import X`     | Canonical — `pulseengine/core/app.py`             |
| `from pulseengine.core.storage import X` | Canonical — `pulseengine/core/storage.py`         |
| `from pulseengine.local.scan import X`   | Canonical — `pulseengine/local/scan.py`           |
| `from app.analysis import X`             | Shim — re-exports from `pulseengine.core`         |
| `from storage.storage import X`          | Shim — re-exports from `pulseengine.core.storage` |
| `from src.engine import X`               | Shim — re-exports from `pulseengine.core.app`     |

`conftest.py` imports `storage.storage as storage` so that `monkeypatch.setattr` targets the correct module object.

Network calls are mocked at the point of use in `src/engine.py` (the backward-compat shim). When writing new tests against canonical modules, patch at the canonical location:
- `"pulseengine.core.app.fetch_price_history"`
- `"pulseengine.core.app.fetch_news_articles"`
- `"pulseengine.core.app.analyse_market_context"`

## When to update tests

| Change                                              | Action required                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| New key added to `analyse_asset()` result           | Usually nothing; avoid strict key snapshots           |
| `analyse_asset()` top-level contract changed        | Update smoke expectations in `test_pipeline.py`       |
| RSI/ROC formula replaced                            | Re-check range/sign invariants and edge-case behavior |
| Signal score clamping removed                       | Clamping tests should fail intentionally              |
| Dedup threshold changed                             | Review boundary tests in `test_logic_coverage.py`     |
| Storage retention windows changed                   | Review age-based tests in `test_storage_and_scan.py`  |
| Functions moved between `pulseengine/core/` modules | Update patch targets and imports accordingly          |

## Adding a new test

Before adding a test, ask:
- **Does it protect against a real regression risk?** Good.
- **Does it verify an invariant, edge case, or side effect that matters?** Good.
- **Is it brittle to harmless refactors?** If yes, simplify it.

## Running the tests

```bash
# Standard run
pytest

# Single file
pytest tests/test_core.py -v

# With full traceback
pytest --tb=long
